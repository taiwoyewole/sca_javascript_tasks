In your own terms, define what a Closure is in Javascript

 *** Closure is created when an inner function has access to the outer enclosing function variables or functions. ***
 
 
 What is result?

 var a = 1;

function someFunction(number) {
  function otherFunction(input) {
    return a;
  }

  a = 5;

  return otherFunction;
}


var firstResult = someFunction(9);
var result = firstResult(2);

*** firstResult prints out the inner function that is being returned. ***
*** result prints out 5. ***

What will you see in the console for the following example? Explain Why
var a = 1;
function b() {    
  a = 10;
  return;
  function a() {}
}
b();
console.log(a);

*** console.log(a) prints 1 to the console. That's because the console.log is called outside the function. Therefore, it prints the value of the global-scoped variable a which is 1. ***
